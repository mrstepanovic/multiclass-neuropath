# multiclass_neuropath

Healthy elderly cortex appears quite different from tissue affected by frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). But how can these visually-striking large-scale patterns of brain atrophy be classified quantitatively into pathological diagnoses?

This project aims to use machine learning towards this end. More specificially, it trains a supervised multiclass support vector machine (SVM) using the one-v-rest approach, implemented with the scikit-learn library in Python 3.5.
